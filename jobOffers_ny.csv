This system will direct the purchasing decisions on media at a scale few people get to contribute to in our industry.  Developing our own proprietary technologies allows us to deliver highly scalable, efficient and robust solutions and gives you the opportunity to apply your algorithms at a global scale. As a member of our Data Science team, you will be interacting with product management and have responsibility to research, design and work with engineering to implement your teams algorithms at scale.  The Xaxis work environment is inviting. You will work in an open modern space where you will often find groups in casual brainstorming sessions sharing ideas and strategies for new initiatives. Everyone has a voice at Xaxis, and we are open to new ways of thinking, especially those that will contribute to the overall success of Xaxis.

If a path of research bears significant fruit and needs optimization, we can optimize the underlying technologies later. We would rather sacrifice some up-front performance for immediate learnings and scale later. We are deep believers that premature optimization is the root of all evil and that the real value in good data science is the rapid unfolding of new ideas that can be harnessed at scale to drive success.

If a path of research bears significant fruit and needs optimization, we can optimize the underlying technologies later. We would rather sacrifice some up-front performance for immediate learnings and scale later. We are deep believers that premature optimization is the root of all evil and that the real value in good data science is the rapid unfolding of new ideas that can be harnessed at scale to drive success.
