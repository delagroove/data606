In recent years, we have undertaken a large-scale digital transformation initiative, building on the success of our current mobile and online service offerings. The Digital team is responsible for building innovative platforms and developing new products that make banking and payment tasks simpler and more personalized for our customers, as well as deepen customer engagement and loyalty with more relevant offers and services. The ambition is to position Chase as the undisputed leader in digital financial services and payments, and to enable highly personalized, real-time experiences that customers increasingly expect. We function similar to a fintech start-up in our brand new offices that inspire collaboration, transparency, agile development, and a fun working environment.  The Digital Intelligence team’s mission is to deeply personalize the user experience of our millions of customers through the use of the firm’s massive data, machine learning and proprietary data platforms. Whether it’s building a financial graph of consumers and small businesses, optimizing ad targeting on chase.com/mobile and paid media sites, recommending the most relevant hotels, or detecting fraudulent behavior, we work at the intersection of statistics, machine learning and engineering to tackle some of the most challenging and interesting problems you will find in digital banking, commerce and payment. Many companies claim that they work on “big data” and “data science”. We live and breathe them every day.  The ideal candidate has deep skills in one or more areas mentioned below, and is passionate about solving real-world problems. We are looking for those select few who thrive in a dynamic environment, have big ideas and goals, and believe in testing ideas rather than talking about them. They are hands-on, without needing an army of engineers or other data scientists to support them, and love learning new skills along the way.

Participation in KDD and Kaggle competitions will be a big plus.  · MS/PhD in a quantitative discipline such as Statistics, Physics, Economics, Applied Math, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Computational Sciences, with coursework and projects in machine learning and data analysis. Publications in top machine learning, AI or data science conferences and journals are highly desirable.  · Solid understanding of algorithms to build recommendation systems, interest graphs, ad targeting models, trend analysis, and fraud/anomaly detection using online and offline features. A big part of the role is to be able to ask open-ended questions, explore new ideas, and choose appropriate techniques for solving a given problem, rather than using packages as a black box to a known problem.  · Familiarity with A/B testing is a big plus, especially if you have experience in improving online/mobile product features by running customer/cookie-level experiments.  · Familiarity with Apache Hadoop and Spark ecosystems of open-source tools and ML packages very desirable.
