"Source:  USCIS, as of June 30, 2017. Notes: All data are based on approved petitions during the fiscal year. Per USCIS best practices, units of less than 10 are aggregated so as to limit the possibility of the de-anonymization of data.  “D” represents data withheld to protect privacy. Total number of beneficiaries includes initial, renewal, cap-subject, and cap-exempt petitions. While some company names may appear multiple times, USCIS does not combine companies even where the names are the same because in all cases the employer tax identification numbers are different. Missing Education means the education field is not captured by the USCIS electronic data storage system. Average salary includes both full-time and part-time employment.  In lieu of the required degree a beneficiary may qualify based on a combination of education, training, and/or progressively responsible experience in the specialty that is equivalent to the completion of such a degree, and recognition of expertise in the specialty through progressively responsible positions directly related to the specialty.",,,,,
